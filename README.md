# Image Processing Operations

This repository demonstrates fundamental image processing operations using the popular OpenCV library.

OpenCV offers a wealth of functions for various image manipulations. My goal is to elucidate these operations.

## Features

This repository has been divided into two parts:
- [basic image processing](/basic%20image%20processing%20operations/)
    covers basic image procesing operations.
- [advanced imageprocessing](/advanced%20image%20processing%20operations/)
    covers more advanced image processing operations

Each operation is explained in detail within the Python notebook, complete with code examples and visual outputs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing.git
    cd basic-image-processing
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Create a new conda environment
    conda create -n image_processing_env python=3.7 -y

    # Activate the environment
    conda activate image_processing_env

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `image_processing.ipynb` file and run the cells to explore the operations.
